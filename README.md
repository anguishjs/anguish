# Anguish.js

The Regressive JavaScript Framework.

## What?

This is a proof of concept for a Vue-like markup-only framework like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) or
[petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue). It aims for an even smaller bundle size, being currently at 1.2kb
(700 bytes gzipped!) with most of the core implemented.
